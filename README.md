B. ****Algorithms****:

1.**Find 2nd Highest CGPA:**

1. Initialize highest and secondHighest to minimum values.
2. Iterate through each CGPA:
   If the current CGPA is greater than highest, update secondHighest to highest and set highest to the current CGPA.
   Else if it's greater than secondHighest, update secondHighest.
3. Print secondHighest.


2.**Sort CGPA in Descending Order:**

1. Use nested loops to implement a bubble sort:
2. Compare adjacent elements.
3. If the current element is less than the next, swap them.
4. Print the sorted array.


3.**Binary Search for CGPA:**

1. Accept user input for CGPA.
2. Implement binary search:
3. Set left and right pointers.
4. Calculate the mid index and compare the middle element with the target.
5. Adjust pointers based on comparisons until found or exhausted.
6. Print the result.


4.**Generate and Analyze Random Numbers:**

1. Generate an array of 10 random integers.
2. Print all numbers.
3. Initialize max and min to the first element.
4. Iterate through the array to find the maximum and minimum values.
5. Print the results.


5.**Break Down Amount into Notes:**

1. Define an array of note denominations.
2. For the given amount, iterate through the note array:
3. Calculate how many notes of each denomination can fit into the amount.
4. Print the note and its count, and reduce the amount accordingly.


6.**Print Number Pattern:**

1. Use nested loops:
2. For decreasing pattern, start from n down to 1, print numbers from 1 to i.
3. For increasing pattern, start from 2 up to n, print numbers from 1 to i.


7.**Find 2 Lowest Heights:**

1. Read heights into an array.
2. Initialize lowest and secondLowest to maximum values.
3. Iterate through the array:
Update lowest and secondLowest based on comparisons.
4. Print the results.


8.**Analyze String for Words, Chars, Vowels, and Consonants:**

1. Split the string into words and count them.
2. Iterate through characters to count letters, vowels, and consonants.
3. Print the results.


9.**Count Character Occurrences in a String:**

1. Convert the string to lowercase.
2. Use a hash map to count occurrences of each character.
3. Print the results excluding spaces.


10.**Print Unique Numbers from Array:**

1. Use a hash map to count occurrences of each number.
2. Iterate through the map and print numbers that occur only once.



11.**Remove Vowels from a String:**

1. Initialize a result string.
2. Iterate through the string, appending characters that are not vowels.
3. Print the resulting string.


12.**Calculate Total Cost After Discount:**

1. Define prices for the laptop and mouse.
2. Calculate total price before discount.
3. Calculate discount amount and subtract it from the total.
4. Print the final total price.
